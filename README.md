## Using Your Own Images

Due to the large size of the image files, the `img` folder has not been included in this repository.

### How to Use Your Own Images

1. **Create an `images` Folder**: In the `public` directory of your project, create a new folder named `images`.

2. **Add Your Images**: Place your images inside this `images` folder.

3. **Ensure Filename Matches**: Make sure that the filenames of your images match those referenced in the code. If the code references `mumbai.jpg`, ensure there is a file with that exact name in the `images` folder.

### Example Structure

Your folder structure should look like this:

```plaintext
public/
├── images/
│   ├── home/
│   ├── ├── taj.jpg
│   ├── ├── background.jpg
│   ├── mumbaiImages/
│   ├── ├── mumbai1.jpg
│   ├── ├── mumbai2.jpg
│   ├── ladakhImages/
│   ├── ├── leh1.jpg

---others---
│   └── tick.gif
